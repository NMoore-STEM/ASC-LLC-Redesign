//NOTE: scrollTop did not work when using "console.log($(document).scrollTop())"
//in console because in the bg class/id in the <main> element in HTML had a
//"position: fixed;" declaration which prevented this.  I had encountered the 
//same problem with the Bailey Lab website.  I had used positoin:fixed so the
//background remained fixed as the other elements of the document scrolled.
//Instead, I used "background-attachment: fixed;" which accomplished the same
//desired effect.

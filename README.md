# ASC-LLC-Redesign

Update on the design of the original ASC LLC website.
Starting with MOBILE design, then to FULL design, and finally, the TABLET design.

Many assets from the original website will either be reused or touched up in AI - especially the Logo/Branding.

This website is beign redesigned so as to put my best foot forward when submitting my Junior Web Dev/Designer Portfolio to potential employers.
All portfolio pieces will be hosted in hidden pages on the backend of the ASC LLC website which potential employers will have access to the URL.

# ASC-LLC-Redesign

This is a website to advertise for my consulting company.

**What I used to create this page:**

There was an earlier, more rudimentary, website before this one that used a different design layout.
This project and repository were initially created to track the process of updating Ananda Science Consulting.
During the process of updating this webpage, I decided to shift gears and pursue a career in web design while concurrently serving clientele through my consultancy.

You will notice that my portfolio and other projects are all rooted in my original domain (www.anandascience.com).
My portfolio page shares an identical color scheme and design with my consulting website because it was originally intended as a way to showcase my capabilities to potential clients through a password-protected page.

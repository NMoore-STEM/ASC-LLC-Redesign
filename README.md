# Ananda Science Consulting LLC - Full Redesign

This is a website to advertise for my consulting company.

**What I used to create this page:**
<div><img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original-wordmark.svg" title="VSCode" alt="VSCode" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;

<br>
There was an earlier, more rudimentary, website before this one that used a different design layout.
This project and repository were initially created to track the process of updating Ananda Science Consulting.<br>
<br>
During the process of updating this webpage, I decided to shift gears and pursue a career in web design while concurrently serving clientele through my consultancy in the interim as I learned more.
<br>
<br>
You will notice that my portfolio and other projects are all rooted in my original domain (www.anandascience.com).
My portfolio page shares an identical color scheme and design with my consulting website because it was originally intended as a way to showcase my capabilities to potential clients through a password-protected page.<br>
<br>
Additionally, this repository was one of my earlier attempts to familiarize myself with GitHub and tracking my work.  Due to my inexperience at the time this repo was created and because I changed direction mid-project (more focus on my portfolio), much of the tracking of my portfolio page creation was done here as well.

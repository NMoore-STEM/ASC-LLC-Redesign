# Ananda Science Consulting LLC - Full Redesign

This website was originally created in 2020 to advertise for my consulting company.  
This repository tracks my process in updating the design and code.

### What I used to create this page:
<div><img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original-wordmark.svg" title="VSCode" alt="VSCode" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
<img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/html5/html5-original-wordmark.svg" title="HTML5" alt="HTML" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
<img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/css3/css3-plain-wordmark.svg"  title="CSS3" alt="CSS" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
<img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/jquery/jquery-original-wordmark.svg" title="Jquery" alt="Jquery" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
<img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/illustrator/illustrator-plain.svg" title="Illustrator" alt="Illustrator" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
<img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/blender/blender-original.svg" title="Blender" alt="Blender" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
</div>
I also used a Jquery library called jquery.inview which can be found <a href="https://github.com/protonet/jquery.inview">here</a>.

### Features I am proud of:
- Custom-designed, 3D hero image  
- Scroll-position-based scripted animation  
- Contact form designed/written/scripted from scratch  
  - Formcarry redirect overridden
  - Custom regular expression applied to email field
  - Security feature included to prevent bot form submission
  - Scripted selective form data being sent by using `data.serialize()`
- Animated UX feedback on form submission

<strong>During the process</strong> of updating this webpage, I decided to shift gears and pursue a career in web design while concurrently serving clientele through my consultancy in the interim as I learned more.

<br>
You will notice that my portfolio and other projects are all rooted in my original domain (www.anandascience.com).
My portfolio page shares an identical color scheme and design with my consulting website because it was originally intended as a way to showcase my capabilities to potential clients through a credentialed portal.  As a result of my initial plan, the tracking of my portfolio website is also included in this repository.<br>

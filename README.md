# ASC-LLC-Redesign

Update on the design of the original ASC LLC website.
Starting with MOBILE design, then to FULL design, and finally, the TABLET design.

Many assets from the original website will either be reused or touched up in AI - especially the Logo/Branding.

This website is being redesigned for submitting my Junior Web Dev/Designer Portfolio to potential employers.
All portfolio pieces will be hosted in hidden pages on the backend of the ASC LLC website which only potential employers will have access to the URL.

NOTE: By adding an underscore in lieu of the space with my splash code/title for the portfolio page (cred.html), then using Nick_Moore.toString() in console will produce: "your,new,employee"
This is important because not only does it have design appeal, but is also functional JavaScript code.
